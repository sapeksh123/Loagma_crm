## ✨ Vercel Deployment (Recommended - 2 minutes)

### Option 1: GitHub Integration (Easiest)

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already)
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel auto-detects settings (already configured via `vercel.json`)
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Done! 🎉

### Option 2: Vercel CLI (Faster)

```bash

npm install -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy

# Follow prompts, then visit your URL!
```

**Your app will be live at**: `https://your-project.vercel.app`
